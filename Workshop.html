          <h2> Our Workshop</h2>
          <p>
            Don’t know anything about bicycle repairs? No problem! Volunteer mechanics 
            are on duty to assist you, from finding a bike that’s right for you, 
            adjusting your seat, or fixing a flat, right up to building an entire bike 
            from just parts. Bike Edmonton operates a fully-equipped, volunteer-run, community bike 
            workshop. We have the tools (including specialty tools) needed to repair and 
            maintain your bicycle, and  mechanics to teach you how to do it. We have a
            large selection of used and new parts. We also have many used bicycles for 
            sale, starting at $40 for basic as-is bicycles, and between $150-350 for most 
            refurbished bikes
          </p>
    
          <h2 style="padding-top:101px;">General Info</h2>
          <p>
            Bike Edmonton’s community bicycle workshop offers a welcoming space for 
            cyclists of all skill levels to learn bike repair with guidance from 
            volunteer mechanics. Visitors can donate used bikes or parts, purchase 
            refurbished bikes, and find both used and select new parts.While there are some 
            restrictions—DIY hydraulic bleeding is not permitted, nor are gas-powered bikes—Bike Edmonton
            supports a wide range of repairs, though its capacity for high-end components and suspension 
            work may be limited. The workshop, one of North America's longest-running, encourages in-person visits 
            for inventory inquiries, as they’re unable to hold items or store bikes.
